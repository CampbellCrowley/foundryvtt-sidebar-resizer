# Compatibility issues?
I work on this module based on my personal preferences, and of course share it with others because I love doing so!

Having said that, I only use a small limited subset of modules myself, and making modules work with others out there takes work, 
which I am usually honestly not motivated to do. Do consider inviting me a Coffee and let me know which one doesn't work for you, I'll be more inspired afterwards :)

Do track the issue however, it is good that it is not forgotten, or of course feel welcome to submit a pull request that makes it work and I'll happily accept it and give credits.
