# Sidebar Resizer and Chat Editor
Allows users to resize the sidebar of Foundry VTT, including the Chat Popout.

Adds the possibility of Formatting the Chat with a rich editor (Experimental). The formatter is disabled by default.

Hover over the edge of the sidebar or the top of the chat, and a resize cursor should appear, drag to the size you prefer. Will remember the size, individual to the computer you are using.

# Compatibility issues?
I work on this module based on my personal preferences, and of course share it with others because I love doing so!

Having said that, I only use a small limited subset of modules myself, and making modules work with others out there takes work, 
which I am usually honestly not motivated to do. Do consider inviting me a Coffee and let me know which one doesn't work for you, I'll be more inspired afterwards :)

Do track the issue however, it is good that it is not forgotten, or of course feel welcome to submit a pull request that makes it work and I'll happily accept it and give credits.
